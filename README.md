# Mycelium
Simulates the growth of mycelium and demonstrates how the fungi find nutrition to continue colonization of substrate.

INTRODUCTION

  In nature, certain materials such as fallen trees can be broken down by saprophytic fungi and used for nutrition. This project simulates the beginning stage of that process; we can see what happens when a spore germinates in a new place and searches for nutrition. This process is not perfect; sometimes the mycelium does not find nutrition in its local area and runs out of energy, even though the next source is so close. How sad. However, if it does find the next source of nutrition, even if it's just a small splinter of wood, the mycelium will propogate further using every bit of nutrition from that splinter.

  While not included in this simulation of the beginning stages of germination, if the mycelium has colonized enough of the substrate and created a decent-size network, the whole mass breaks down and consumes every bit of energy from the material it's on. Once it runs out of nutrition, it's time to find a new place to thrive. The mass works together to thrust a reproductive organ (yep, That's what a mushroom is) from the mycelial mass and out into the open. The mushroom cap opens up, revealing its gills from which millions of new spores will drop to be carried away to a new place to call home, for a little while.

INSTRUCTIONS:

  All of the buttons on the bottom are toggle-able, besides Reset. Toggle either the New Food or New Spore buttons and click anywhere in the black space a few times.
Toggle the other button, and do the same thing. Press Start/Stop to toggle the simulation and see how it spreads.
You can keep the simulation running while dropping new spores or food pellets as well if you'd like.
